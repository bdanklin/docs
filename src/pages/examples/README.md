# Smplrspace examples

Each folder in this directory is a sample project. The easiest way is to browse them live on [our docs](https://docs.smplrspace.com/examples).

Note that the example projects are implemented with React. For
vanilla Javascript, you would load the script and stylesheet like
any other in your HTML `head` and add a script to end of the `body` that corresponds to the code found in the `onLoad` function. Refer to the [embedding spaces](https://docs.smplrspace.com/guides/embedding) guide for more details.
